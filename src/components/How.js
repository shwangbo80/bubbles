          <p>
            Bubble Tea is a fun and simple drink to make at home, but before you
            start, you wil need the fol owing ingredients and equipment.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Tea</h4>
          <p>
            Duh! Bubble tea was traditionaly made with black tea, but you can
            use green, chai, yerba mate, or any kind of tea. You can even use
            coffee!
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Tapioca Pearls</h4>
          <p>
            Also known as boba (and referred to as such much through this book),
            black tapioca pearls are smal , round bal s made from tapioca
            starch. Tapioca pearls are about the size of smal marbles and have a
            distinctively chewy texture. The texture is very similar to Japanese
            mochi or gummy bears. Tapioca pearls usualy come in two sizes and
            can be found in your local Asian grocery store, or available to
            purchase online. It is best to use the black, green, or
            multi-colored tapioca pearls made specificaly for bubble tea.
            Regular tapioca pearls will disappoint, as they fal apart when
            cooked. Note: Tapioca pearls are high in calories! A 1.1-oz. serving
            of black tapioca pearls contains 68 calories, according to the Nuts
            Online website. When folowing a 2,000-calorie diet, this accounts
            for 3.4 percent of your total daily calorie al owance. Most of the
            calories in black tapioca pearls come from carbohydrates. A 1.1-oz.
            portion of black tapioca bal s contains 17g, or 13 percent of the
            130g that the Institute of Medicine recommends you consume daily. A
            serving of black tapioca pearls also provides you with 1 percent of
            the calcium you need each day. For a lighter alternative, hunt down
            coconut jelly (Nata de coco) and chop it into smal squares.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Tapioca Noodles (Tapoodles)</h4>
          <p>
            Tapoodles look like smal, thick noodles and are an alternative to
            tapioca pearls - they have the same chewy texture. Tapoodles are
            available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, mango, and
            caramel.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Popping Boba</h4>
          <p>
            One of the newest developments in the bubble tea world is popping
            boba - tapioca pearls that are filed with juice that - as the name
            suggest - pop when they are eaten. They can be purchased online in a
            variety of flavors, but can be a little pricey.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">16oz Clear Cups or Tal Glasses</h4>
          <p>
            Most of the recipes listed are suitable for 16oz drinks, and it is
            in clear plastic cups that iced bubble tea is drunk through. Not
            only are clear cups cheap, durable and recyclable, but they allow
            you to easily see where the last of your tapioca pearls are hiding!
            Of course, for hot bubble tea drinks, you'l want glasses that are a
            tal, but more heat resistant.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Dome Lids</h4>
          <p>
            If not already supplied with the aforementioned cups, consider
            investing in dome-shaped lids for your homemade bubble tea. These
            types of lids tend to offer a much wider opening for your straw than
            flat lids - essential for inserting and wiggling the fat straw you'l
            need to attack your bubble tea effectively.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Fat Straws</h4>
          <p>
            Bubble teas are traditional y sucked through extra large straws.
            This is to al ow easy consumption of the tapioca pearls, which would
            otherwise lay uneaten at the bottom of the glass. A pack of 50 "fat"
            bubble tea straws wil set you back as little as $3.49 on Amazon.com
            and other websites. They are manufactured in lots of bright colors,
            which is great if you want to get your kids involved in bubble tea.
            WARNING: Tapioca pearls shoot up through fat straws into your mouth
            as you drink bubble tea, and do come with a slight risk of choking,
            especialy for children. If you don't want to go with straws, feel
            free to use a spoon as an alternative method to scoop out your
            tapioca pearls.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Cocktail Shaker or Thermos Flask</h4>
          <p>
            To combine bubble tea ingredients and create the bubbly froth needed
            to complete the drink, many recipes involve the use of a cocktail
            shaker (or Thermos flask as an alternative) to vigorously mix the
            ingredients together.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Blender / Food Processor</h4>
          <p>
            Especialy for cold bubble tea recipes, you'l need an blender or ice
            crusher to mix up al of the ingredients.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-4">Optional: Bubble Tea Powder</h4>
          <p>
            Bubble tea powders come in a wide array of colors and flavors and
            one scoop is usual y enough to add sufficient taste to your drink.
            Varieties of bubble tea powder include chocolate, coconut, passion
            fruit, raspberry, peach, watermelon, and strawberry. Be aware that
            bubble tea mixes contain a lot of sugar, powdered creamer, high
            fructose corn syrup, and artificial coloring, making them a lot less
            healthy than using natural ingredients, as in all of the folowing
            recipes.
